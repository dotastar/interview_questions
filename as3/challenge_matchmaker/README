Interview Problem: Dungeon Matchmaker

Problem Statement
In many MMORPGs, users must form a party before entering a dungeon. However, oftentimes, players don't have enough friends online or do not have friends of the necessary classes to successfully traverse the dungeon. Therefore, many popular MMORPGs have implemented a matchmaking service where players queue themselves for a dungeon and the service will group together users such that:

- all party members fulfill the minimum level requirements
- the party has players that fulfill all of the class requiremenets (eg. most parties need a healer and a tank)
- all things being equal, players should have precedence over players that queue after.

Add code to the MatchMaker.enqueue() function to detemine if such a party exists and print out the party members

Definitions
Player: a player is a user, having three properties: class, name, and level.
Dungeon: a dungeon has three properties: miniumum level requirement, required classes, and minimum level requirement
